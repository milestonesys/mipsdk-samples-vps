# Video Processing Service Toolkit sample projects

The *VPS Toolkit* is a MIP SDK toolkit that allows you to forward video from an XProtect camera 
device to a GStreamer pipeline. Video and/or metadata output from the GStreamer pipeline can be 
brought back into the XProtect VMS through a VPS Driver-based device. However, this is not 
mandatory; it is up to you how to consume the output of the GStreamer pipeline.

This repo contains sample projects that demonstrate how to use the *VPS Toolkit*.
